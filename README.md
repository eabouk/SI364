# SI364
Building applications class in SI at University of Michigan

FINAL PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

My project Iâ€™m going to create is a web facing interface for music data (music dataset TBD). It will have 
tables for Artists, Tracks, Albums, Genres, Users and Record Label associated with the albums. A many to many 
relationship would be that an artist can create many albums, and albums can have many artists on it 
(collaboration or compilation albums, like NOW! and others). Some of the many to one relationships are the 
many songs that are created by one artist, the many songs on one album, and the many artists that are on a 
single record label. 

User interactions will include the ability to log in to view the database, and ability to comment and respond 
to comments on an album or artist page. For the purpose of the scope and time limitations of SI 364, this will 
not have a music player option and will simply be a text based data project.
